# Titanic Survival Analysis â€” Business-Oriented Data Analytics

This project demonstrates a professional, business-driven approach to analyzing the Titanic dataset. It combines robust data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and actionable business insights, reflecting an analytical mindset shaped by real business experience.

## Project Structure
- `src/` : Source code (main analysis script)
- `data/` : Dataset(s)
- `notebooks/` : (Optional) Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `outputs/` : (Optional) Generated plots or results

## Analytical Approach
1. **Data Quality & EDA**: The script begins with summary statistics and missing value analysis, highlighting the importance of data quality for business decisions.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and irrelevant features to ensure reliable results.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Segments passengers by age group for more actionable insights.
4. **Survival Analysis**: Calculates and visualizes survival rates by class, gender, and age group.
5. **Business Insights**: Interprets results in a business context, providing recommendations for real-world decision-making (e.g., resource allocation, safety protocols).

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.8+
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Place `TitanicDataset.csv` in the `data/` folder.

## Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python src/Titanic.py
```

## Example Output
- Console: EDA summary, missing value analysis, survival rate table, and business insights.
- Plot: Bar chart of survival rates by class, gender, and age group.

## Business-Oriented Insights
The script identifies the most and least vulnerable passenger groups and provides recommendations as if advising a real business (e.g., cruise line safety, marketing focus). This demonstrates the ability to translate data into actionable strategies.

## Data Source
- Titanic dataset (Kaggle or similar)
